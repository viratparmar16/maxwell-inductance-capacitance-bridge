# Maxwell Inductance–Capacitance Bridge: Construction & Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the construction and experimental analysis of a 
**Maxwell Inductance–Capacitance (L–C) Bridge** to accurately determine the 
**inductance and series resistance of an unknown medium-Q inductor**.  
The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **AC bridge balancing, 
impedance comparison, and electrical measurements**.

## Objectives
- To construct a Maxwell L–C Bridge using standard laboratory components  
- To measure the inductance and series resistance of an unknown inductor  
- To verify theoretical balance equations through practical experimentation  
- To understand phasor relationships and AC bridge balancing principles

## Theory
The Maxwell Inductance–Capacitance Bridge is an AC bridge used to measure 
unknown inductance by balancing it against a **standard capacitor** and 
non-inductive resistors. The use of a capacitor provides higher accuracy 
and stability compared to a standard inductor.

At balance, the impedance ratios of opposite arms are equal, and the detector 
shows zero deflection.

### Balance Equations
\[
L_1 = R_2 \times R_3 \times C_4
\]

\[
R_1 = \frac{R_2 \times R_3}{R_4}
\]

Where:  
- \(L_1\) = inductance of the unknown coil  
- \(R_1\) = series resistance of the unknown coil

## Components Used
- Unknown inductor (medium-Q)
- Non-inductive resistors (R₂, R₃)
- Variable resistor (R₄)
- Standard capacitor (C₄)
- AC supply
- Digital multimeter (null detector)

## Methodology
1. The bridge circuit was assembled according to the Maxwell L–C configuration.  
2. Fixed resistors were placed in two arms, while the unknown inductor occupied one arm.  
3. A variable resistor and standard capacitor were connected in parallel in the opposite arm.  
4. AC supply was applied, and the bridge was balanced by adjusting the variable resistor.  
5. At null condition, inductance and resistance were calculated using balance equations.

## Results
- The calculated inductance and resistance values closely matched the known 
  specifications of the inductor.
- Minor deviations were within acceptable experimental error limits.
- The results confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the Maxwell L–C Bridge 
  for medium-Q inductors.
